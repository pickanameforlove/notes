make可以编译程序(you can use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.)，除此之外，make还可以适用于某些文件，它依赖于某些文件的更新而更新。

当你修改某个源文件的时候，the make program uses the makefile data base and the last-modificaiton times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.

**If you are new to make, or are looking for a general introduction, read the first few sections of each chapter, skipping the later sections. In each chapter, the first few sections contain introductory or general information and the later sections contain specialized or technical information.**
